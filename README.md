Task:
Create a social app for sharing a location’s information with friends. The app must utilize Google Maps and Google’s Places API to share and display Place details with any of a user’s contacts.
 
Required Features:
•	List a user’s contacts from their phone
•	Send Google Place information to any of a user’s contacts (share through email, sms, etc)
•	For each of a user’s contacts, maintain the history for each place sent to that user.
•	Allow users to view details of places
•	Allow users to view selected places as markers on Google Maps.
•	Include an autocomplete search bar for places
 
You are free to design the app any way you like, but the app should be compatible with older OS versions.
 
You will be not expected to complete this entire task end to end. We are looking to see how you deal with an overwhelming task and how you would organized your approach. Be prepared to discuss your angle of execution in person, as we will be reviewing your app during the interview. 
 
Hint: You will need to create a your own API keys for Google Maps and Google Places through the Google Developer Console.
